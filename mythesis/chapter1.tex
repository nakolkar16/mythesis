\chapter{Theoretical Concepts and Experimental Basics}
\label{sec:SM}
%==============================================================================

This chapter presents an overview of theoretical and experimental concepts widely used in
particle physics. The Standard Model of particle physics which is by far the best theory explaining
fundamental particles and their interactions, is described in \cref{sec:SMdes}. Even though the 
Standard Model describes and predicts most of the phenomena occurring in nature, it still has some drawbacks
which are discussed in brief. Important concepts required to understand physics manifested 
at hadron colliders are also discussed. Among the fundamental particles, the top quark is one of 
main particles studied in this thesis. A detailed description of top quark and its associated
processes are discussed in the end of this chapter. 


\section{The Standard Model (SM)}
\label{sec:SMdes}

In the 19th century, John Dalton postulated that matter is made up of small indivisible 
pieces called atoms. Since then, technological advancements and human curiosity have empowered 
us to explore various phenomena around us in greater detail. Eventually, our understanding of nature 
evolved, leading to the development of the Standard Model of Particle Physics, that explains the 
fundamental structure of matter. The Standard Model (SM) of particle physics is a 
theory that explains almost everything that nature has to offer. It is based on fundamental particles 
and their interactions being governed by Quantum Field Theories (QFTs). The SM has precisely predicted
existence of various particles and their properties. Testing the SM and its predictions plays a
crucial role in deciding the physics program of Particle Physics experiments.  

The Standard Model is divided into spin-1 fermions and spin-0 bosons. The fermions are
further divided into leptons and quarks as shown in \cref{fig:SM}. Another
classification of fermions is into generations. The first generation includes
\Pup, \Pdown, \Pelectron and \Pnue which constitutes the matter around us. The second
and third generation particles are high energy \textit{siblings} of the first generation
particles. These are observed at high energies such as at colliders. The SM also includes
anti-particles which are clones of particles with opposite quantum numbers.

    and green are fermions while the ones shown in red are gauge bosons. The three generations
    are also highlighted by roman letters. Anti-particles are not shown~\cite{SM}.}%
    \label{fig:SM}
\end{figure}

The fermions interact with each other by exchanging bosons which are also called 
\textit{force-carrier} particles. The photon (\Pphoton), being massless and electrically 
neutral, is the messenger of the electromagnetic (EM) force, experienced only by charged particles.
The underlying QFT is called Quantum Electrodynamices (QED) based on the U(1) symmetry group. The
commonly known electrostatic attraction between charged particles is the low-energy manifestation of QED. Among 
the SM, all fermions except neutrinos are sensitive to the EM force. The strength of the EM force
is expressed by its dimensionless coupling constant,

\begin{equation}
    \alpha \sim \frac{1}{137}
\end{equation}

The strong interaction, mediated by massless gluons, is experienced by particles 
carrying the so-called \textit{colour} charge. The physics behind the strong interaction is 
explained in Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD). The quarks, which are the only particles carrying colour charge,
can interact via the strong interaction. A peculiar thing in QCD is that the gluons themselves also 
carry colour charge. This property is unique for a force-carrier particle. 

The weak force carriers are the vector bosons, \PWpm and \PZ, which unlike \Pphoton and 
gluons, are massive and charged in case of \PWpm boson. The \PZ boson is electrically neutral. The weak
interaction manifests itself in phenomena such as $\beta$-decay and fusion processes inside the sun. All the
SM particles, including the neutrinos, are sensitive to the weak force. 
The interaction mediated by \PWpm and \PZ is called charged-current weak interaction and
neutral-current weak interaction, respectively. The famous Wu experiment~\cite{Wu:1957my} proved that 
the charged current weak interaction violates parity. The parity violating nature of the weak interaction
suggests that the interaction configuration must be different from that of QED and QCD. Studies showed that
the weak interaction is described using a $V-A$ vertex and this fact dictates that only left-handed
chiral particle states and right-handed chiral antiparticle states can participate in 
charged-current weak interaction. 

The theory unifying QED and weak interaction is called the Electroweak theory explained in 
\cref{sec:ewtheory}. The last piece of the SM puzzle, which is the last discovered fundamental particle,
is the Higgs boson. It is a spin-0 boson, unlike other bosons. All particles acquire their mass 
through the Higgs mechanism.

\subsection{Feynman diagrams}

As predicted by the SM, there are different possible ways through which two particles can interact.
Having a tool to visualise these interactions would greatly aid in understanding the 
underlying physics. In Particle Physics, a tool called Feynman diagrams is used for this purpose. 

These diagrams are symbolic representations of particle interactions. They make use of straight lines 
with arrows to show incoming and outgoing particles and anti-particles. Wavy lines are used to show
the boson exchanged between them. It also has a hypothetical time axis which demonstrates the
evolution of the process with time. The Feynman diagrams are just a pictorial representation and have no 
physical meaning. 

For a better understanding of Feynman diagrams, consider an example of Bhabha scattering. 
There are two possible Feynman diagrams for this process 
as shown in \cref{fig:bhabha}. The left diagram represents electron-positron scattering and 
reads as following: an electron and positron enter, a photon is exchanged between them and the two particles exit.
This configuration is called a $t$-channel diagram. The right diagram, called an $s$-channel
diagram, is obtained by twisting the $t$-channel diagram. It represents electron-positron annihilation
where an electron-positron annihilates into a photon which in turn produces an electron-positron pair. 
The point of interaction between two particles is called a \textit{vertex}. The time axis is horizontal from left to
right. It is vital to note the direction of arrows in particle lines. The arrow directions 
for particles and antiparticles are opposite to each other.
In the shown diagram, the incoming electron points in the forward direction, denoting the 
evolution of the interaction with time, whereas the incoming positron points in the backward direction.
Following the arrow directions illustrates a continuous current flow.

    \end{tabular}
    \caption{The $t$-channel (left) and $s$-channel (right) Feynman diagrams showing Bhabha scattering }
    \label{fig:bhabha}
\end{figure}


The quantitative analysis for a process includes two important steps: accessing the Feynman diagrams to
compute the amplitude ($\mathcal{M}$) and together with the phase space, calculating quantities such as 
decay rate, cross-section and differential cross-section. The Feynman diagrams are 
analysed through a set of rules called Feynman rules. It is important to note that
for each process, there are infinite possible Feynman diagrams which require to be summed to get the 
accurate final process description. The diagrams shown in \cref{fig:bhabha} 
are examples in which participating particles are known real particles because they 
have definite masses. A
process can also have intermediate stages where temporary particles are produced which are not
observed, but simply represent the nature of interaction. Such \textit{virtual} particles can have varying masses.
Presence of intermediate states lead to 
more vertices inside a diagram and therefore give rise to a plethora of Feynman diagrams for a certain 
process. 

In the context of Feynman calculus, each vertex within a diagram contributes a factor equal to the 
coupling constant of the interaction. Hence, the actual process can be quantitatively described in terms
of expansion with respect to the coupling constant. For the expansion to converge, the coupling constant
needs to be small. The most basic diagram with the lowest order expansion
is called a "tree-level" or a "leading-order (LO)" diagram. The diagram corresponding to the next order
of expansion is called a next-to-leading-order (NLO) diagram. Higher order diagrams with more vertices 
contribute less owing to the small coupling constant. 


\subsection{The Strong Force}
Electrons and nucleus inside an atom are held together by the electromagnetic force. The same 
force also exists between protons inside the nucleus causing repulsion which can destabilise the 
nucleus. However, there exists a force
which is strong enough to overcome the repulsion and keep the nucleus together. It is called the strong force or 
the strong nuclear force. The QFT describing the strong force is called Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) and the
underlying symmetry group is SU(3) described by $3 \times 3$ matrices. The eight generators of the SU(3) group
give rise to eight gluons which are the strong force mediators. The structure of the SU(3) group demands that 
the wave function of the strongly interacting particle must be a 3-component vector. This gives rise to 
a new degree of freedom called "colour", with three states called red, blue and green. Consequently, particles
having a non-zero colour charge can feel the strong force. Among the SM particles, only quarks have the colour
charge which can be either red, blue or green.

A major differentiating factor between QCD and QED is that the gauge boson in QCD carries the charge of 
interaction. In other words, gluons also carry the colour charge which allows them to interact with other 
gluons as well. As a result of this self-interaction, no coloured object can be found as a free particle in 
nature. Due to this so-called colour confinement, quarks cannot exist independently but instead are found in
colour-neutral states called \textit{hadrons}. For instance, if two quarks are pulled away from each other, a gluon field is 
created between them which is proportional to the separation. The gluon fields is so strong that at some point,
the energy in this field is sufficient to produce new quarks and antiquarks that form colourless bound states
with the original quarks and antiquarks.
This process is called hadronisation. Due to colour confinement, only certain configurations for hadrons
are permitted. The possible combinations discovered so far can be categorised into mesons (\Pquark{}\APquark),
baryons (\Pquark{}\Pquark{}\Pquark) and antibaryons (\APquark{}\APquark{}\APquark).

The value of the strong coupling constant, $\alpha_S$, is relatively larger compared to the coupling 
constant of QED. As a consequence, contribution of higher order Feynman diagrams
increases making calculations difficult. One of the
great discoveries in QCD is that the strong coupling constant is in fact not a "constant" but instead the
value is dependent on the energy scale of the interaction~\cite{Deur:2016tte}. The running of $\alpha_S$ means that at low
energies, the force between the quarks is stronger (larger $\alpha_S$) whereas at higher energies, the 
force becomes weak (smaller $\alpha_S$). The running of $\alpha_S$ allows us to apply 
perturbation theory for calculations
at high energies. This property of QCD is called asymptotic freedom. 

\subsection{The Electroweak theory}
\label{sec:ewtheory}
In the 1960s, physicists were trying to formulate a gauge theory for weak interactions
similar to QED. A theory can be a gauge theory if it has an underlying mathematical symmetry
and it is renormalisable. A quantum field theory is renormalisable if the divergences can be absorbed
by implementing finite number of parameters, such as, a coupling constant. Glashow,
Salam and Weinberg discovered such a gauge theory by unifying electromagnetic force and 
the weak force.

The electroweak (EW) theory is a unification of QED and the thoery of weak interactions. 
It is described by the symmetry group $SU(2)_L \otimes U(1)_Y$. The corresponding
charges of the electroweak theory are the weak isospin $I,I_3$ and the weak hypercharge $Y$.
The weak hypercharge $Y$ determines the interaction under the $U(1)$ transformations.
The weak isospin of particles determines their transformation under $SU(2)$ and therefore, it is
used to make multiplets of particles. The left-handed leptons ($\Plepton_L$) will form doublets
because they transform into each other under the influence of weak force. 
This is due to the $V-A$ vertex form of the weak interaction. On the other hand, the right-handed 
particles are singlets ($\Plepton_R$). 

\begin{align}
    \Plepton_R = e^{-}_R, \mu^{-}_R, \tau^{-}_R \\
    % \Plepton_R = \Pelectron_R, \Pmuon_R, \Ptau_R \\
    \Plepton_L = \begin{pmatrix} \Pnue \\ \Pelectron \end{pmatrix}_L , \begin{pmatrix} \Pnum \\ \Pmuon \end{pmatrix}_L , \begin{pmatrix} \Pnut \\ \Ptau \end{pmatrix}_L 
\end{align}

The EW model introduces three bosons $\PW_\mu^{(1,2,3)}$ corresponding
to $SU(2)$ and one $B_\mu$ corresponding to $U(1)$. The experimentally observed $\PWpm$
are combinations of $\PW_\mu^{(1)}$ and $\PW_\mu^{(2)}$ whereas photon ($A$) and the Z-boson are linear
combinations of $\PW_\mu^{(3)}$ and $B_\mu$ based on the weak mixing angle ($\theta_W$)
as given below:

\begin{align}
A_\mu = +B_\mu \text{cos} \theta_W + W_\mu^{(3)}\text{sin} \theta_W \\
Z_\mu = -B_\mu \text{sin} \theta_W + W_\mu^{(3)}\text{cos} \theta_W 
\end{align}

The weak interaction for the quark sector can be explained by creating similar
$SU(2)$ doublets(Q).

\begin{align}
    Q = \begin{pmatrix} u \\ d' \end{pmatrix}, \begin{pmatrix} c \\ s' \end{pmatrix}, \begin{pmatrix} t \\ b' \end{pmatrix}
\end{align}

The strength of the weak interactions for quarks is determined experimentally by studying
nuclear $\beta$-decay. It is observed that the vertices corresponding to different quark
flavours have different coupling strengths. The reason for this is given by the Cabibo
hypothesis which states that, the flavour eigen states that participate in the weak interactions
are a mixture of the mass eigen states. The relation between them is given by the 
Cabibo-Kobayashi-Maskawa (CKM) matrix. 

\begin{align}
    \begin{pmatrix} d' \\ s' \\ b'\end{pmatrix}
     = \begin{pmatrix} V_{ud} & V_{us} & V_{ub} \\
                       V_{cd} & V_{cs} & V_{cb} \\
                       V_{td} & V_{ts} & V_{tb}
    \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} d \\ s \\ b\end{pmatrix}
\end{align}

The values of the CKM matrix elements can be found in \cite{pdg2024}. The diagonal
of the matrix is close to unity, suggesting that the weak interaction is stronger within
the same generation of quarks. 

Validation of the EW theory was obtained through experimental observations. The experiments at the 
Gargamelle bubble chamber in 1973 hinted the evidence of a neutral
massive boson responsible for the observed neutrino interactions~\cite{HASERT1973138}. In 1983, the \PZ-boson
was directly discovered at the Super-Proton Synchrotron at CERN and this discovery verified
the electroweak theory. The properties of the \PZ-boson were extensively
studied at the Large Electron-Positron (LEP) collider at CERN. The discovery of \PZ and \PW 
bosons are among the crucial tests of the Standard Model. 


\subsection{The Higgs mechanism}
According to the electroweak theory, weak bosons are required to be massless for the 
underlying symmetry to be preserved. However, experiments revealed that the weak gauge bosons, \PW and 
\PZ have finite masses~\cite{Brout-Englert-Higgs:1998492}. The explanation of this spontaneous symmetry breaking was given by the 
Brout-Englert-Higgs mechanism~\cite{PhysRevLett.13.508}.
Particles in the SM acquire their mass through the Higgs mechanism. It is a way of 
spontaneously breaking SM symmetries by introducing a new field called the Higgs field. The strength of
interaction of particles with this field determines how massive the particles will be. Higgs mechanism
implies the existence of a scalar particle, the SM Higgs boson. In a landmark discovery, the Higgs 
boson was independently discovered by ATLAS and CMS in 2012~\cite{ATLAS:2012yve,CMS:2012qbp}. Since then,
the Higgs boson studies are an important part of major collider physics programs. 

\section{Limitations of the SM}
The Standard Model is a highly successful theory that has been tested at various collider experiments 
and almost all the experimental results agree with the predictions, at a high degree of precision. Despite
its enormous success, there are still some drawbacks of the SM. They are summarised below:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Out of the four fundamental forces, only three are explained in the SM. Gravity is not included.
    \item SM predicts that neutrinos are massless but experiments have proved that neutrinos are not massless.
    \item The difference in the mass scale of vector bosons/Higgs boson and the Plank scale is extremely 
    large. This is known as the hierarchy problem and is unexplained by the SM.
    \item There is no explanation of why is there more matter around us than antimatter.
    \item The possible existence of dark energy and dark matter is hinted from studies regarding
    expansion of the universe. There is no explanation in the SM. 
\end{itemize}

\section{Physics at the hadron colliders}
Colliders are a great place to test the SM and also search for new particles. At hadron colliders,
hadrons are accelerated to high energies in order to collide them. The 
outcomes of these collisions are analysed and compared with theoretical predictions. Some quantities
regarding collider physics are discussed in the following section.  

% \subsection*{Natural units}

\subsection*{Center-of-mass energy}
In a collision between two particles the total center-of-mass energy is expressed as
\begin{equation}
    \sqrt{s} = \sqrt{(\Sigma_{i = 1}^{2} E_i)^2 - (\Sigma_{i = 1}^{2} p_i)^2},
\end{equation}
where $E$ and $p$ are energy and momentum of the two initial state particles. If two colliding beams 
of the same particle type have the same energy, then the center-of-mass energy is 
$\sqrt{s}$ = $2E_{beam}$, neglecting the masses of particles. 

\subsection*{Transverse momentum}
The axis along which the colliding particles are boosted is referred to as the beam axis or 
longitudinal axis. The sum of momentum components along the transverse axis (perpendicular 
to the beam axis), is called transverse momentum,
\begin{equation}
    \pT = \sqrt{p_x^2 + p_y^2}.
\end{equation}
where beam is along the \textit{z}-axis. 


\subsection*{Decay rate and branching ratio}

An elementary particle often decays into smaller particles through the possible decay modes or 
channels, depending on the conservation laws for quantum numbers and strength of the decay process. 
The probability per unit time of a particle decaying is called its decay rate ($\Gamma$). For $N$ 
identical particles the change in the number after time \textit{dt} is given by
\begin{equation}
    dN = - \Gamma N dt.
\end{equation}

The lifetime of the particle is the time after which the sample becomes $\frac{1}{e}$ of its original 
size,
\begin{equation}
    \tau = \frac{1}{\Gamma}.
\end{equation}

When multiple decay modes are possible, the total decay rate of the particle is the sum of individual 
decay rates. In order to learn the dominance of a certain decay mode, we calculate its branching 
ratio (BR). The branching ratio of a decay mode $i$ is defined as
\begin{equation}
    \text{BR} = \frac{\Gamma_i}{\Gamma_{\text{total}}}.
\end{equation}


\subsection*{Parton Distribution Functions (PDFs)}
Hadron collisions at high energies give rise to deep inelastic interactions called hard processes.
In such cases, the interactions are not between two hadrons but between their constituents which are
quarks and gluons, collectively known as \textit{partons}. These partons carry a fraction of the total
momentum of the hadron. In order to study an interaction, it is important to
know the effective energy of the interacting partons and their flavour. This information is encoded in 
the Parton Distribution Functions (PDFs). It provides quantitative information regarding the distribution
of energy carried by the quarks and gluons inside a hadron. A PDF
describes the probability of finding a parton of certain flavour $i$, carrying a momentum 
fraction $x_i$ at a certain energy scale. The PDFs are extracted from experimental data. 

\subsection*{Pileup}
The colliding particles are divided into bunches before collisions. Each bunch will give rise to
multiple interactions, some of them would be hard interactions resulting from maximum momentum transfer, while
others would be soft interactions with minimum momentum transfer. 
The primary hard scatter collisions, that are usually the main focus of analyses, are 
contaminated by soft interactions. It is called pileup, defined by the average number of interactions
recorded per bunch crossing. Sources of pileup are categorised into in-time and out-of-time pileup. In-time pile up is due to collisions
occurring in the same bunch-crossing and out-of-time pile-up is contributed by the collisions from previous
or later bunches. 

Some of the sub-detectors have sensitivity windows longer than the interval between
bunch crossings, this directly affects the recorded number of interactions per bunch. The accurate
detection of objects under study becomes difficult due to pile-up events. The higher the 
luminosity, more the pileup. The object reconstruction algorithms have dedicated procedures 
to mitigate pileup in order to accurately reconstruct the interactions of interest. \Cref{fig:pileup}
shows average number of interactions per bunch crossing with respect to the recorded luminosity
during 2015 to 2018 for the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.8\figwidth]{mu_2015_2018.pdf}
    \caption{Distribution showing average number of interactions versus luminosity per bunch crossing for the
    2015 to 2018 collision data at \SI{13}{\TeV} center-of-mass energy~\cite{twikipileup}.}%
    \label{fig:pileup}
\end{figure}

\subsection*{Luminosity and cross-section ($\sigma$)}
The quantity that measures the ability of a collider to produce particle interactions is called
instantaneous luminosity ($\mathcal{L}$). The instantaneous luminosity integrated over the lifetime
of collider operation is called integrated luminosity ($L$). During the operation of the LHC
from 2015 to 2018, the delivered integrated luminosity is shown in \cref{fig:lumi}.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.8\figwidth]{intlumivstimeRun2.pdf}
    \caption{Total integrated luminosity delivered by LHC shown in green and that recorded by
    the ATLAS experiment shown in yellow. The data corresponds to the year 2015 to 2018~\cite{twikilumi}.}%
    \label{fig:lumi}
\end{figure}

In order to define the event rate for interesting processes, along with luminosity, we require
another quantity called the cross-section. At the subatomic scale, the particle interactions 
are governed by the laws of quantum physics. Therefore, a theory can predict 
the \textit{probablility} of certain outcomes of collisions. The probability of a certain
process to occur is called its cross-section ($\sigma$). Finally, the event rate of
specific interactions is defined as the product of integrated luminosity and the cross-section (\cref{eq:lumi}).
\begin{equation}
    R = \sigma \cdot \int_{dt} \mathcal{L}(t)
    \label{eq:lumi}
\end{equation}

For a particle collider, beam energies and luminosity are two important figures of merit. 
High energy allows the production of new heavy particles and high luminosity allows more flux 
of particles contributing to large number of collisions.

\subsection*{Differential cross-section}
Differential cross-section is a type of cross-section which gives the probability of an interaction
with respect to a variable X. In common practice, differential cross-section is defined as $d\sigma/dX$,
where $dX$ can be solid angle in scattering experiments or kinematic variables such as \pT. The 
integral over the entire range of $X$ gives the total cross-section. 

The differential cross-section offers a deeper insight into the process of interest. For example, in a 
scattering experiment designed to investigate the internal structure of a target, the scattering 
profile of the incident particles is analysed. If the scattering rate varies at different solid angles,
 this variation will be captured in the differential cross-section measurements. 

Another advantage of studying differential cross-section is that if there is any new physics,
it may manifest itself by altering the kinematic distributions of known SM particles. Measuring the 
differential cross-sections with respect to kinematic variables and then comparing them to SM predictions
is one of the crucial tests of the SM. Any deviations in the comparison can hint towards new physics.
A differential analysis is based on the shape of the kinematic distribution and not just the 
total events in the distribution. Therefore, differential cross-sections can be used for various
theory interpretations.

\section{Top quark physics}
The electroweak theory states that the left-handed particles forming weak isospin doublets can
interact weakly. In 1977 the bottom quark was discovered and it led to the prediction of its weak 
isospin partner, the top quark \Ptop. This prediction was made to keep the electroweak theory internally
consistent. After puzzling the scientists for around two decades,
the first observation of the top quark was in 1995 at the Tevatron collider at Fermilab by
CDF and D0 collaborations~\cite{PhysRevLett.74.2626,PhysRevLett.74.2632}.
The top quark is the heaviest fundamental particle discovered so far with a mass of 
\SI{172.57 \pm 0.29}{\GeV}~\cite{ParticleDataGroup:2024cfk}.

The top quark being the weak isospin partner of the bottom quark, completes the three 
generation structure of the SM. Since its discovery, the top quark has been a crucial part of
the physics programs at hadron colliders because of its unique properties. The lifetime of the top quark
is so short that it decays before it can hadronise. This property gives us a unique opportunity 
to study a "bare" quark because some of its properties are conserved in the decay process and 
passed on to its decay products. Regarding the decay products, the top quark decays almost exclusively
into a \PW boson and a \Pbottom quark. 

Study of the top quark is interesting due to various reasons. Its large mass suggests strong coupling to
the Higgs field, therefore studying top quarks can give insights into the Higgs sector. In addition, 
evidence of new physics can be possibly extracted from top quarks because
several beyond SM physics models suggest that heavy particles might decay into top quarks~\cite{Gallinaro_2013}.

After the shutdown of the Tevatron, LHC remains the only place to produce top quarks in abundance,
which is why the LHC is called a top factory. Due to the large center of mass energy, processes
involving top quarks along with heavy bosons are also possible at the LHC. These processes
are sensitive to electroweak and strong couplings. Therefore, precise measurements in this field
can prove as an important test of the SM.


\subsection{Production modes}
The top quark can be produced either as a top-antitop pair in the so-called pair production mode
or as a single top in association with a light quark or a W-boson. The most dominant mode
is the pair production mode mediated by the strong force. The single top production proceeds via
the electroweak interaction as discussed below. Studying the different production channels of the
\Ptop-quark offers insights into QCD and the electroweak sector. Moreover, measurements of the 
cross-sections are used to extract important parameters of the SM such as the top quark mass. 



\subsection*{Pair production}
At LHC energies, gluons inside protons are prone to numerous self interactions and splitting which in 
turn produces more and more gluons available for production of heavy particles. 
The dominant production of top quarks at the LHC is the top-antitop (\ttbar) pair production~\cite{ATLAS:2016zet}. It is
initiated either by gluon-gluon fusion, which is the dominant channel, or through quark-antiquark annihilation.
The leading-order Feynman diagrams are shown in \cref{fig:ttbarprod}. The inclusive cross-section
of the \ttbar production measured by ATLAS and CMS collaborations at $\sqrt{s}$=\qty{13}{\TeV} is
shown in \cref{fig:ttbar_cs}. The results are found to be in agreement with the SM prediction.
The measurements of top pair production is useful for studying PDFs, specifically 
gluon PDFs~\cite{FABBRI201763}.

    \label{fig:ttbar_cs}
\end{figure}

\subsection*{Single-top production}
There are three separate processes at LO leading to the production of a single-top quark.
Based on the virtuality of the exchanged $W$-boson, the possible modes
are $t$-channel, $s$-channel and associated $Wt$-channel as shown in \cref{fig:topprod}.
The $t$-channel process is initiated by a \Pbottom-quark and a spectator quark, producing 
a single top and a light jet. This process has the largest production cross-section at the LHC.
The $s$-channel is characterised by a quark-antiquark pair interacting to produce
a single top and a bottom quark. The requirement of an antiquark in the initial state largely
suppresses this process~\cite{Cristinziani_2017}. In the associated $Wt$-channel,
a gluon and a bottom quark produces a single top and an on-shell \PW-boson. Its final state is 
same as the \ttbar process with one less \Pbottom-jet. The associated $Wt$ process is an 
important background for other top quark and Higgs related measurements~\cite{ATLAS:2024ppp}.

Due to the electroweak
nature of the single top production, it is sensitive to various parameters such as 
the $V_{tb}$ element of the CKM matrix and the $Wtb$ coupling~\cite{Andrea:2023yap}. The 
single top production cross-section measurements by ATLAS and CMS are shown in \cref{fig:singletop_cs}.

\subsection{Rare associated top quark processes}
Measurements of rare processes at the LHC are important tests to validate the SM. Therefore,
physics program at the LHC is heavily involved in precision measurements related to rare processes,
especially those involving top quarks. 
The top quark being the heaviest fundamental particle so far, has strong links to the Higgs
sector and also to potential BSM physics. Moreover, top quark associated processes probe 
electroweak couplings of the top quark which are fundamental parameters of the SM. 
Therefore, it is relevant to study rare processes involving top quarks. The production 
cross-sections of various top quark associated processes are shown in \cref{fig:topX_cs}.

The associated production of a single top with a photon, called \tqgamma production, probes
the coupling between top and photon. It is studied using the full \SI{13}{\TeV} dataset by ATLAS
and CMS in the leptonic channel due to the higher sensitivity compared to hadronic channels. The
measured cross-section is in agreement with the SM prediction~\cite{PhysRevLett.131.181901}.

The evidence for an associated production of a top quark with two heavy bosons (\tWZ) is 
reported by the CMS collaboration. Studies are performed using the \SI{13}{\TeV} dataset
in the leptonic channel and the measured cross-section corresponds to a statistical
significance of 3.4 standard deviations~\cite{CMS:2023krq}. 

The associated process of a top quark and a \PZ boson, called the \tZq production,
is one of the rare processes at the LHC and it is the main focus of this thesis. This process
is interesting because it probes two different kinds of couplings through the same interaction.
Detailed description is given in \cref{sec:tZqdescribe}.The cross-sections of \tZq, \tWZ and 
\tqgamma, as measured by ATLAS and CMS, are compared in \cref{fig:topX2_cs}. 
The \tZq process is also useful in
studying Flavour-Changing-Neutral-Current (FCNC) couplings. The SM forbids 
interactions of fermions with \PZ boson, where the flavour of the incoming quark is changed. 
However, some extension models of SM predict otherwise. A dedicated search for FCNC processes involving
a top quark, an up-type quark and \PZ boson was conducted by ATLAS using the full Run-2 dataset.
The goal was to look for events corresponding to either (\Pgluon{}\Pq$\rightarrow$\Ptop{}\PZ)
or events where \Ptop decayed into \PZ (\Ptop $\rightarrow$ \Pq{}\PZ). Despite the efforts, no 
evidence for FCNC processes was found~\cite{ATLAS:2023qzr}.

One of the rarest and heaviest process at the LHC is the production of four tops (\tttt).
This process is interesting because it simultaneously probes the coupling of four 
fermions. In addition, various BSM models predict potential modification in the 
cross-section, hinting towards new physics. The four tops production was observed 
at the LHC at 6.1 standard deviation and its
cross-section, measured by the ATLAS experiment using \lumi at \SI{13}{\TeV} center-of-mass energy,
is $\qtypmerr{22.5}{6.6}{5.5}{\femto\barn}$~\cite{ATLAS:2023ajo}. It is found to be consistent with the SM prediction.

    A clear difference in the cross-section is visible in the dominant \ttbar process and 
    the rarest four tops process. The \tZq process falls towards the tail of the plot implying
    that it is one of the rare processes~\cite{ATL-PHYS-PUB-2024-006}.}%

% close to the Electroweak scale, the top quark might play an important role in understanding
% Electroweak Symmetry Breaking (EWSB). Moreover, the fact that $m_t$ is greater than $m_H$ hints whether
% the top quark gets its mass through Higgs mechanism.
