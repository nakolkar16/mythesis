\section{The Large Hadron Collider}
The Large Hadron Collider is a two-ring proton-proton collider situated near Geneva across the Swiss-French border. It is built in the 26.7 km long tunnel 
that previously housed the Large Electron-Positron (LEP) collider. 


The LHC has two tranfer tunnels of 2.5 km each that connects to the CERN accelerator complex.
