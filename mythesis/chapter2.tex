\section{The Large Hadron Collider}
The Large Hadron Collider is a two-ring proton-proton collider situated near Geneva across the Swiss-French border. It is built in the 26.7 km long tunnel 
that previously housed the Large Electron-Positron (LEP) collider. 

Fixed target and collision with other particles, th elatter gives the hightest CM energies(refer teracslae book)

The LHC has two tranfer tunnels of 2.5 km each that connects to the CERN accelerator complex. 

Macimum energy and achievable luminosity are important design parameters of an accelerator. High energy allows production of new heavy particles and high 
lumi allows more flux of particles contributing to high number of collisions.
